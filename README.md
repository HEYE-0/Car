# Bluetooth-Controlled Obstacle Avoidance Robot Project (Qt + C++)

## üìå Project Overview

This project is developed based on the Raspberry Pi 5 and fully implemented in C++. It builds an autonomous obstacle avoidance robot system. A Qt graphical interface enables real-time control of the robot‚Äôs movement, motor speed adjustment, ultrasonic distance monitoring, and camera feed display. The architecture is modular and features a custom multithreaded real-time scheduler (TaskScheduler) to replace traditional polling, achieving soft real-time control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build & Run

### üîß Build

```bash
make         # Build the Qt GUI application (robot_gui)
make test    # Build the command-line testing tool (test_robot)
```

### üöÄ Run

```bash
./robot_gui         # Launch the Qt graphical control interface
sudo ./test_robot   # Run the test program (requires root for GPIO access)
```

## üß† Real-Time Scheduling Design

- All real-time tasks (camera capture and ultrasonic measurement) are registered in `TaskScheduler` and executed on separate threads.
- Each task runs on a fixed interval (e.g., camera every 50ms, ultrasonic every 300ms).
- `std::condition_variable::wait_until()` is used to control wake-up timing and avoid polling overhead.
- Task execution durations are recorded via `std::chrono` for basic delay analysis.

## üñºÔ∏è GUI Features

- **Directional control buttons**: Forward, Backward, Left, Right
- **Speed control slider**: Adjusts motor PWM output (0‚Äì1023)
- **Live camera view**: Real-time preview from the front camera
- **Ultrasonic distance display**: Shows distances from front, left, and right sensors
- **Status label**: Displays the robot‚Äôs current action (e.g., Forward, Stopped)
- **Start/Stop buttons**: Initializes or shuts down the control system

## ‚úÖ Project Highlights

- Fully modular and object-oriented design
- Non-blocking, thread-safe real-time task scheduling
- High-precision ultrasonic measurement using `chrono`
- Decoupled GUI and control logic via Qt + OpenCV
- Entirely written in C++
