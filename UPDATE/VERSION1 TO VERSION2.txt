In the first version of our project, we developed an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot car based on Raspberry Pi using a modular C++ architecture. It utilized four motors, two L298N motor drivers, and three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to detect and respond to obstacles. The system employed an event-driven structure with callback interfaces and used libgpiod for blocking echo signal detection, ensuring both real-time responsiveness and structural clarity.
In the second version, we extended the system by integrating a camera module (Kamera V2, 8MP/1080p) and implemented real-time video capture using OpenCV. The camera operates in a parallel thread, independent from the robotâ€™s obstacle avoidance logic, thereby enhancing environmental perception without compromising performance. This addition lays the foundation for future extensions such as color recognition or object tracking, and marks the transition from a purely sensor-based system to a hybrid control platform with vision support.
