In this version, we upgraded the original command-line-based robot project to a fully Qt-based graphical interface version. The main changes include the creation of a ControlPanel class, which provides buttons to control the robotâ€™s direction, a slider to adjust motor speed, and real-time display of both the camera feed and distance readings from three ultrasonic sensors. The Robot class was refactored to support variable speed inputs and to encapsulate sensor access. The Ultrasonic class was improved using std::chrono for high-precision distance measurement. The Camera class was updated to remove legacy imshow() display and instead offer a readFrame() method for integration with the Qt interface. Additionally, the Makefile was revised to support both the Qt GUI application and a command-line testing tool. These changes ensure that the system is modular, well-encapsulated, and extensible, meeting the design standards expected in an embedded systems course.
